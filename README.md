# rightmove_web_scraping

The goal for this repository is to scrape rightmove for any keywords (or no keywords), by location, and to publish various infographics in a file. So for example running `rightmove -keywords "pricate garden", "double glazing" -location London`  will return a file that shows how many properties have those keywords in London, their average price and number of bedrooms etc.

Hopefully I will also include something that prints a cute picture in the terminal when something is run.

Need to add tests and make this very easily usable.

Could also look at:
- dates when posted
- is there a way to scrape old listings that aren't live anymore?
